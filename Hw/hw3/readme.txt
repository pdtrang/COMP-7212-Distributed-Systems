HOW TO RUN:

	python hw3.py

FEATURES:
	- The program will generate a graph with 100 nodes and each node has degree at least 26.
	- After generating graph, the program will draw and save graph into a png file.
	- User can enter a number of super peers, the program will divide the real network into regions such that there would be one super peer per region.
	- Graph of super peers is saved in a png file.
	- User can re-enter number of super peers at runtime.
	- User can enter source node and destination node to get the route on both real network and overlay network.
